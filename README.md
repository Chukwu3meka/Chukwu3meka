<h1 align="center">Hi <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="24px"> I'm Chukwuemeka</h1>

I‚Äôm a Full stack Developer with expertise in building high-quality web applications with proven track record of both freelance and full-time work. Among other tools I'm capable of using, My favorite for frontend development includes: <b>Next.js</b>, <b>Material-UI</b>, and <b>SCSS</b>. For backend development I prefer to use <b>Express (a Node.js framework)</b>, <b>Mongoose</b>, and <b>MongoDB</b>.<br/>

Despite having a <b>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science</b> üéì I recognize the importance of continuous learning in the field of technology that's always evolving. To stay current and provide efficient and dependable solutions for modern-day problems, I'm currently exploring <b>Rust</b> due to its intriguing features such as memory safety, concurrency, and performance.<br/>
