<h1 align="center">Hi <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="24px"> I'm Chukwuemeka</h1>

As a Software developer, I specialize in developing both <b>Desktop</b> and <b>Full Stack Web</b> applications. My preferred tools include <b>Next.js</b> - A React Framework, <b>Express.js</b> - A node Framework, and <b>Electron.js</b> - To build cross-platform desktop apps.

Although I have a <b>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science</b> üéì I recognize the importance of continuous learning in the field of technology that's always evolving. To stay current and provide efficient and dependable solutions for modern-day problems. My mentor <b>[Marcus Eagan](https://github.com/MarcusSorealheis)</b> introduced me to <b>[Zig Programming Language](https://github.com/ziglang)</b>, and I am currently exploring it due to its compelling features that prioritize safety, performance, and simplicity.
