<h1 align="center">Hi <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="24px"> I'm Chukwuemeka</h1>

As a Software developer, I create Desktop and Fullstack web applications using Next.js (A React Framework), Express.js (A node Framework), and Electron.js. Although I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I recognize the importance of continuous learning in the field of technology that's always evolving. To stay current and provide efficient and dependable solutions for modern-day problems, I'm currently exploring Rust due to its intriguing features such as memory safety, concurrency, and performance.
