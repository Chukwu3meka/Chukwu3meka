As a Fullstack developer, I am involved in building various types of applications such as Web (using Next.js - React), Mobile (using Flutter), Server (using Node.js - Express.js and Java), Desktop (using Electron), and Database (using MongoDB, Firebase, and Postgre).

Currently, I am working on building new applications and maintaining existing Exchange applications at Zenith Bank. Additionally, I am intrigued by the idea of contributing to open-source projects.

My current focus is on learning Full-text Search with Java (using Apache Lucene)/MongoDB Atlas Search, which I was introduced to in 2022 by [my mentor](https://github.com/MarcusSorealheis). The field is constantly evolving, and I believe in continuous learning, even with a Bachelor's degree in üéì Computer Science.
